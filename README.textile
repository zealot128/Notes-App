h1. pludoni Note App

inspired by makandra notes i decided to programm this blog-like app for taking programming related notes. I didn't find any that fit my needs so i did that one.
Also, this was a great opportunity to test the new Rails 3.1 Features, like assets.

h2. Features:

* Styling - Solarized color scheme
* Syntax Coloring by coderay
* image attachment
* link attachment -> with preview image generation powered by wkhtmltoimage (wich is bundled for 64bit systems)
* The usual: feeds, pagiation, admin interface
* Authentication with devise
* **tumblr-like** Bookmarklet for fast-reblogging of content
* Rails 3.1 with compass and coffeescript.


h2. TODO

* Installation of wkhtml needs some description but is pretty easy actually
* cause the app is more like a composition of great ruby gems, i do not use any tests
